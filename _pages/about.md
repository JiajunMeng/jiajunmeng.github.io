<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Economics and Management at Beihang University. My research interests include online platforms, the economics of AI, the operations–marketing interface, and behavioral economics. Methodologically, I employ game-theoretic and analytical modeling approaches.
