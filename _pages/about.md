<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome! My name is Jiajun Meng (孟嘉俊). I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Economics and Management at Beihang University. 

My research investigates quantitative marketing and the marketing–operations interface, with a particular focus on online platforms and the application of AI in business. In addition, I am also interested in some topics in microeconomics and industrial organization, such as consumer search and behavioral economics. Methodologically, I employ game-theoretic and analytical modeling.
